v1.0.2
An elegant patch!

+ The bell ringing sound now plays when the Dragon is killed
# The Dragon Egg is now spawned at 1 block above the highest block of bedrock at 0, ~, 0
  This change was made because it is more elegant than just dropping the Egg at a high y-value

--------------------------------------------------

v1.0.1
Post-release patch.

# Fixed version command as the version was listed as 2.0.0

--------------------------------------------------

v1.0.0
First official release.

+ Complete rework of code
+ The Dragon Egg is spawned at 0, 80, 0 as a physical block instead of an item upon the death of the Dragon
  This change was made because the Dragon Egg item would often fall into the portal
+ An announcement in chat when anyone defeats the Dragon and when the datapack is loaded
+ Added info function to let players know who created the datapack
+ The Dragon being killed by a player is being handled with an advancement that is immediately revoked
