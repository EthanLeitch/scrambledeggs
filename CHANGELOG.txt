v1.0.0
First official release.

+ Complete rework of code
+ The Dragon Egg is spawned at 0, 80, 0 as a physical block instead of an item upon the death of the Dragon
  This change was made because the Dragon Egg item would often fall into the portal
+ An announcement in chat when anyone defeats the Dragon and when the datapack is loaded
+ Added info function to let players know who created the datapack
+ The Dragon being killed by a player is being handled with an advancement that is immediately revoked

Alpha versions & revisions
No official releases were made as the project was in alpha.

+ Modified the Ender Dragon loot table to drop the egg upon death
# Patched related bugs
